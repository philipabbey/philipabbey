- 👋 Hi, I’m @philipabbey
- 👀 I’m interested in FPGA and ASIC
- 🌱 I’m currently learning detailed physical synthesis strategies for "implementation"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing presently

A slightly messy 24 years of experience across a range of technologies mostly at the pioneering or low maturity end of the scale. 11+ years in ASIC & FPGA design, and authoring supporting software. Having delivered ASIC and then FPGA designs for 10 years I had 15 years in other roles before returning to FPGA design. 21 years in industrial research roles. Dabble in software in my "free time".
